// This code does not execute properly. What is the solution?
// function multiply (a,b){
//    a * b

//P: The function will take in numbers to be multiplied.

//R: The original code does not specify what will be returned. It should return the product of the numbers multiplied.

//E: If we are given the numbers 7 and 4, the function shoulder return the product of 28.

//P: Create a function that returns the product of two numbers.
